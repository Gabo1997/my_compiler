Hello there <br>
This is a program (compiler) that translates my own programming language into Assembly language (made in java). <br>
The sintax is very easy to understand, and contains only the basics. <br>
The grammar, syntax trees and regular expressions are in the "grama_arbo_E.R" file. <br><br>

Inside the "compi" folder is all the code (java files and txt files). <br>
In "mi_lenguaje" file you can write my language. For example here, this code has 2 errors, which will be shown in the error table when the program is run. <br>

<br>
Once you have written without errors, the "cod_ensam.txt" file will be written automatically in assembly language, and then you can copy and paste it into an assembly language emulator 8086, in my case I used this https://emu8086.waxoo.com/

Forgive my lack of professionalism using github, I'm just learning how to use it.  <br>
Also sorry for the parts that are in Spanish, the compiler was going to review it in Spanish at my university.
